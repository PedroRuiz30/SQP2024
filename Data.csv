The four dyes were composed of different donor groups, i.e. indoline, carbazole, triphenylamine, and coumarin. We investigated the effects of the DPP unit and different donors on the spectra and electrochemical properties of the dyes, respectively. In comparison with the model dye which adopts a phenylene unit as the π-spacer, the DPP dyes all display remarkably enhanced spectral responses in the visible region of the solar spectrum. The key to this increase was the incorporation of electron-deficient DPP moieties to the molecular core, which significantly lowers LUMO levels and therefore reduces the band gap. The dye/(TiO2)46 anatase nanoparticle systems were also simulated to show the electronic structures at the interface. We studied some key properties including absorption spectra, light-harvesting efficiency, molecular orbital distributions, and injection time of electrons from the excited state of dye to the conduction band of TiO2. The dye DPP-I with indoline moiety as the electron donor demonstrates desirable energetic, electronic, and spectroscopic parameters for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) applications. Our theoretical study is expected to provide valuable insights into the molecular design of novel DPP-based organic dyes for the optimizations of DSSCs. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, the Quantum chemical techniques such as density functional theory (DFT) have become a powerful tool in the investigation of the molecular structure and vibrational spectrum and are finding increasing use in application related to biological systems. The optimized molecular structure and the vibrational spectra were calculated thanks to the DFT method resorting to the B3LYP function with the LanL2DZ basis set. Both the experimental and theoretical vibrational data confirms the presence of functional groups in the title compound. Subsequently, the TD-DFT approach was applied to assign the electronic transitions observed in the UV-visible spectrum measured experimentally. The obtained results have been showed that the correlation between experimental and theoretical data is in a good agreement. Besides, the thermal analysis studies were performed, but no phase transition was found in the temperature range between 25 and 600°C.

To enhance the PCE, we have designed four small molecule acceptors P3–P6 based on reported IDT(TCV)2 (P1) and IDTT(TCV)2 (P2), with different central aromatic fused rings, and tricyanoethylene (TCV) as the terminal acceptor unit. The ground-state properties, excited-state properties and photovoltaic properties of donor/acceptor blends are calculated by density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory. Also, the relationship between their photoelectric and structural properties has been discussed. The calculation results show that P5 and P6 can simultaneously increase open-circuit voltages (Voc), fill-factors (FF), and short circuit current (Jsc) due to their high lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, small energy gap and high charge collection efficiency. In terms of charge-transfer mechanism, PTB7-Th/P1–P6 can generate CT states through direct excitation and hot exciton, meanwhile there exist more opportunities of producing CT states via intermolecular electric field mechanism. Our results will provide theoretical guidance for further designing and synthesizing of acceptors to improve the performance of OSCs. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","Charge transfer; computational chemistry; DFT/TD-DFT; molecular design; organic solar cell","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174490707"

Our recent achievement in Pd(II)-catalyzed C1-dearomatization of 2-naphthyl ureas encouraged us to find out the key factors for determining the C1- and C3- regioselectivity of 2-naphthyl ureas based on density functional theory (DFT). In this work, we identified a plausible reaction pathway, which led to the experimental C1-functionalized product with a reasonable energy profile. A homologous pathway giving C3-spirocycle was also calculated to investigate the nature of C1-regioselectivity in this reaction. According to the calculated results, we found that in our reaction C–H cleavage was the regioselectivity-determining step, and that C1 was the kinetically favorable site in this step due to electronic effect which makes C1 a more vulnerable site to electrophiles compared to C3, as reflected by the condensed Fukui function and its larger proportion of the highest occupied molecular orbital. Energy decomposition analyses and electronic structure analyses were further performed, which were in good accordance with our conclusion yet indicated C1 was a more sterically hindered site. This result provided us with the inspiration that steric hindrance may play an important role in frequently reported transition metal-catalyzed C3-arylation in the literature. We then selected a recently reported reaction Pd-catalyzed C3-arylation of 2-naphthyl aniline to study the regioselectivity. The result was in line with our assumption that in C3-arylation of 2-naphthyl aniline the preferential functionalization of C3-site is due to its less steric hindrance than C1-site. This work is thus instructive for understanding the regioselectivity in Pd(II)-catalyzed C–H direct functionalization of C2-substituted naphthalenes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2-naphthyl ureas; DFT calculations; Naphthalene; Regioselectivity; Wavefunction-analyses","Aniline; Catalysis; Computation theory; Density functional theory; Electronic structure; Metabolism; Molecular orbitals; Naphthalene; Regioselectivity; Transition metals; Urea; Competitive reactions; Computational studies; Condensed Fukui functions; DFT calculation; Energy decomposition analysis; Highest occupied molecular orbital; Synthetic organic chemistry; Wavefunction analysis; Palladium compounds","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073706095"

The increase in commercial use of OLED has led to the search for OLED with high performance.

The electron/hole reorganization energies, the adiabatic/vertical ionization potentials, the adiabatic/vertical electron affinities, the chemical hardness values, the dipole moments, the frontier orbital shapes/energy levels, the energy gaps, the emission wavelengths, spin-orbit matrix elements, the rates of reverse intersystem crossing and intersystem crossing of the investigated complexes were determined. From the theoretically obtained data, it was found that Pt(hppz)2 and Pt(fppz)2 complexes can be used as electron transfer material. Furthermore, it was stated that Pt(f2bipz)(bpy) is both electron-blocking layer and hole blocking layer materials. Moreover, it was noted that that PtOEP complex can be utilized as a good electron injection layer and hole injection layer material. Addition to these, it was emphasized that that Pt(f2bipz)(bpy) can be considered as a good candidate for near infrared organic light emitting diodes and thermal activated delayed fluorescent organic light emitting diodes.

In this context, this study aimed to computationally investigate how acridine intercalators interact with DNA by evaluating the mechanism of interactions, binding, and interaction energies using quantum mechanics calculations. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) analysis revealed that acridine has well- distributed negative charges in the center of the molecule, indicative of a dominant electron-rich region. Acridine exhibits well-defined π orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) on the aromatic rings, suggesting that charge transfer occurs within the molecule and may be responsible for the pharmacological activity of the compound. Structural analysis revealed that acridine interacts with DNA mainly through hydrogen bonds between HAcridine… ODNA with bond lengths ranging from 2.370 Å to 3.472 Å. The Binding energy (ΔEBind) showed that acridine interacts with DNA effectively for all complexes and the electronic energy results (E+ZPE) for complexes revealed that the complexes are more stable when the DNA-centered acridine molecule. The Laplacian-analysis topological QTAIM parameter (∇2ρ(r)) and total energy (H(r)) categorized the interactions as being non-covalent in nature. The RGD peak distribution in the NCI analysis reveals the presence of van der Waals interactions, predominantly between the intercalator and DNA. Accordingly, we confirm that acridine/DNA interactions are relevant for understanding how the intercalator acts within nucleic acids. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Acridine; Deoxyribonucleic acid; DFT; Interactions; Intercalation","Acridines; Antineoplastic Agents; DNA; Intercalating Agents; Models, Molecular; Binding energy; Cell proliferation; Charge transfer; Complexation; Hydrogen bonds; Organic acids; Quantum theory; Van der Waals forces; acridine derivative; antineoplastic agent; DNA; intercalating agent; Acridine; Acridine intercalators; Chemotherapeutic drugs; Computational studies; Control-cell; DFT; Global public health; Interaction; Intercalators; Mechanism of action; chemistry; molecular model; DNA","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186123302"

Moreover, we calculate and compare the highest energy occupied molecular orbital and lowest energy unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels of these compounds which act as donor with the ones of the acceptorphenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester. As a result, the investigated molecules show a low band gap, suitable open-circuit voltage and appropriate alignment energy level between the engineered donor molecules and the acceptor phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester.

Solutions containing 0.025 mol/L SnCl2 and/or 0.025 mol/L InCl3 in 1ChCl:2EG were studied by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The diffusion coefficients of the metal ions were measured at temperatures between 297 and 343 K, with the values for Sn2+ being between 3.5 × 10−7 and 5.4 × 10−7 cm2 s−1 and between 0.90 × 10−7 and 1.46 × 10−7 cm2 s−1 for In3+. The morphology and chemical composition of Sn, In and Sn-In electrodeposits were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), the latter showing that Sn as the more noble metal was deposited preferentially. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed the presence of an InSn4 intermetallic phase. Furthermore, to understand better the species present in the solution, the behaviour of Sn2+ and In3+ ions was theoretically analysed through computational simulations involving molecular dynamics, density functional theory and quantum theory of atoms in molecules at four different temperatures. The results indicated that both ions (Sn2+ and In3+) interacted more strongly with the Cl− ion (In-Cl and Sn-Cl) than with ethylene glycol (In-(O1, O2) and Sn-(O1, O2) and showed no interaction with choline (In-O3 and Sn-O3). © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","DES; DFT; Electrodeposition; MD; QTAIM","Binary alloys; Chlorine compounds; Computation theory; Computational chemistry; Cyclic voltammetry; Density functional theory; Electrodeposition; Electrodes; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Ethylene; Indium compounds; Metal ions; Molecular dynamics; Organic solvents; Polyols; Precious metals; Quantum theory; Reaction kinetics; Scanning electron microscopy; Chemical compositions; Choline chloride; Deep eutectic solvents; DES; DFT; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; MD; Metals ions; Modeling approach; QTAIM; Ethylene glycol","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170412563"
